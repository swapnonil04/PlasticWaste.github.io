      <p id="para1" class="para"> Plastic is one of the most versatile and widely used materials in the world today. It is found in everything from food packaging to medical devices to electronics. However, the convenience of plastic comes at a price: plastic waste is a major environmental problem.

        Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in landfills, oceans, and rivers. Plastic does not biodegrade easily, so it can remain in the environment for hundreds or even thousands of years.
        
        Plastic waste has a number of negative impacts on the environment and on human health.</p>

        <p id="para2" class="para">Plastic waste can also have a negative impact on human health. When plastic waste is burned, it releases harmful toxins into the air. 
          These toxins can cause respiratory problems and other health problems.Microplastics, which are tiny pieces of plastic that are less than 5 millimeters in size, are also a concern for human health. 
          Microplastics can contaminate our food and water supply. They can also be inhaled into our lungs.
          The long-term health effects of microplastic exposure are not fully known, but scientists are concerned that they could be harmful. 
          Microplastics have been found in human blood and tissue, and they have been linked to a number of health problems, including inflammation, cancer, and reproductive problems.

          <p id="para3" class="para">
            There are a number of things that can be done to reduce plastic waste. 
              One of the most important things is to reduce our reliance on single-use plastics. 
              This means avoiding products that are made of plastic and that are only used once,
               such as plastic bags, straws, and utensils.
              We can also recycle plastic whenever possible. 
              However, it is important to note that not all plastic is recyclable. 
              It is important to check with your local recycling program to see what types of plastic they accept.
              Finally, we can support businesses and organizations that are working to reduce plastic waste. 
              This could include buying products that are made from recycled plastic or that are packaged in sustainable materials.
              By taking these steps, we can all help to reduce the impact of plastic waste on the environment and on human health.</p>

        <h2 id="header_2">And plastic pollution has been doubling every six years</h2>
        <img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N6VVY4GHTEI6ZDH7GOYFT5GBW4.jpg&w=1200" id="section5img">
        <p id="para4" class="para">
          Humans have filled the world’s oceans with more than 170 trillion pieces of plastic, dramatically more than previously estimated,
          The trillions of plastic particles — a “plastic smog,” in the words of the researchers — weigh roughly 2.4 million metric tons and are doubling about every six years, 
          according to the study conducted by a team of international researchers led by Marcus Eriksen of the 5 Gyres Institute, based in Santa Monica, California. That is more than 21,000 pieces of plastic for each of the Earth’s 8 billion residents. Most pieces are very small.
          <br>The study, which was published in the PLOS One journal, draws on nearly 12,000 samples collected across 40 years of research in all the world’s major ocean basins. Starting in 2004, researchers observed a major rise in the material, which they say coincided with an explosion in plastics production.

        <h2 id="header_3">Preventing plastic pollution in the ocean</h2>
        <p id="para4" class="para">
          The data includes samples from the world’s five major gyres, or current systems, which sweep particles from inhabited areas to create large collections of refuse. The best known of these is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, where plastics float slightly below the surface.

In looking at samples, the researchers concentrated on the North Atlantic and North Pacific ocean basins, partly because they have been studied more frequently over the decades and are where greater concentrations of the world’s population lives. But high concentrations of plastics were found everywhere.

Global negotiators <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/02/08/plastic-pollution-un-treaty/" target="_blank">hope to complete the plastics treaty by 2024</a>. It would regulate all aspects of the life cycle of plastic, including the kinds of chemicals that go into it and whether it’s easily recyclable. Anti-pollution campaigners say it is far easier to deal with plastic before it enters waterways than it is to clean it up afterward.

        <h1 id="header4">From Convenience to Consequence</h1>
        <p id="para4" class="para">Plastic waste often begins in homes and offices as a conveniece, discarded irresponsibly or entering the waste stream.Waste is collected, transported to landfills, and deposited. In landfills, plastic may take hundreds of years to decompose, releasing harmful chemicals into the soil and potentially affecting groundwater. Proper waste management and recycling are essential to reduce these environmental impacts.</p>
